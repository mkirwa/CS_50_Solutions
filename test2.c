    //and return its corresponding frequency in hertz as an int.
    //The frequency, f, of some note is 2n/12 Ã— 440,
    //where n is the number of semitones from that note to A4.
    //Each key on a piano is said to be one semitone, otherwise known as a half step,
    //away from its adjacent neighbor, whether white or black.
    //The effect of # and b, otherwise known as accidentals, is to raise or lower,
    //respectively, the pitch of a note by one semitone.
