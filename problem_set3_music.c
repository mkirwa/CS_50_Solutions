int main(void){
	//Each note on the piano is assigned a letter, A through G
	//a semitone is the interval from one tone to the next
	//When a black note is in between the white semitones then we say they are two semitones apart
	//if the black note is absent then they are 1 semitone apart
	//so semitones are exactly how we are going to refer to a step of exactly
	//one note on the piano keyboard
	//So how are we going to represent the black keys on the piano key board? 
	//white keys are all assigned letters
	//So in order to represent the black keys, we will need to use accidentals
	//accidentals adjust notes up or down one semitone
	//so the sharp(#) accidental represented here by one pound sign means
	//we are going to move up one semitone
	//Up one semitone from c is c#(the black keyboard above c) and from D will be D#
	//you can also represent notes as flats where one flat means move it down by one semitone
	//so db is one semitone down from d

	//you will have to download it, read and understand it
